# Language-Learner
Language Learner is a GUI made in Python using the Tkinter library which allows users to practice the top 100 most frequenced words in French. 

# How It Works
The app starts by displaying a random french word from the csv file previously created. After 3 seconds the card flips and shows the english translation. The user has to either click "✔" or "X" depending on if they knew the word. If the user clicks "✔" the script removes that specific word from the csv file and ensures only new words pop up.
